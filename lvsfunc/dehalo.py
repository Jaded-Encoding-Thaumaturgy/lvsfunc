    Bombines the best of DeHalo_alpha and BlindDeHalo3, and adds some tweaks to the masking.

    This function is rather sensitive to the rx and ry settings.
    Set them as low as possible! If the radii are set too high, it will start missing small spots.

    `darkstr` is set to 0 by default in this function. This is because more often than not,
    it simply does more damage than people will likely want.

    The sensitivity settings are rather difficult to define.
    In essence, they define the window between how weak an effect is for it to be processed,
    and how strong it has to be before it's fully discarded.
